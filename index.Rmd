## What is a random portfolio?
The basic idea is to sample from the population of portfolios that satisfy the given constraints. The idea is simple, but is a very flexible and powerful approach for portfolio optimization and other applications.

> "Random portfolios have the power to revolutionize fund management. You might think that means they must be esoteric and complex. You would be wrong â€” the idea is very simple." - Patrick Burns

## Why Random Portfolios?
* Portfolio Optimization
  * Non-convex and complex objective functions
  * Visualize feasible space
  * Easily parallelizable
* Performance Measurement
* Extend differential evolution algorithm
* Trading Strategy Paremeter Optimization

---

## Algorithms to Generate Random Portfolios
  * Simplex
  * Grid Search
  * Sample

<!--
these are the algorithms that are included in PortfolioAnalytics that I am familar with and will talk about. There may be others. Ask Brian.
-->

---

## Simplex Algorithm
* Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimization in a Parallel Environment (MC-POPE) method by William T. Shaw.
* Shaw recommends this as the best method to evenly sample a simplex or a subject of it.

$$
w_i = \frac{\log U_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N U_j}
$$

where $U_i$ are uncorrelated random variables on $U(0,1)$

<!--
implicit constraints of long only and weights sum to 1
-->

---

## Simplex Algorithm Extensions
* Lower Bound
$$
w_i = L_i + (1 - \sum_{j=1}^N L_j) \frac{\log U_i}{\sum_{k=1}^N U_k}
$$

* FEV-Biasing
$$
w_i = \frac{\log U_i^q}{\sum_{j=1}^N U_j^q}
$$
let $q = 2^p$

## Simplex Algorithm Overview
Advantages
  * Fast and efficient method to generate random portfolios
  * Control portfolio concentration

Disadvantages
  * Limited support for constraints
    * Weights sum to 1
    * Lower bound on weights
  
<!---
* upper bound on weights?
* group?
* dollar neutral?
* position limits?
-->

---

## Grid Search Method
Create all possible combinations given a set of feasible weights
* The portfolio will satisfy box constraints by construction

How do we handle other constraints?
* transformation
* elimination

<!--
transformation may violate box constraints
elimination may not leave many random portfolios
problem with large problems (n!)
-->

---

## Sample Method Algorithm
Based on idea by Patrick Burns
```{r, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
foo <- function(weights, min_sum, max_sum, min, max, ...){
  while (sum(weights) <= min_sum | sum(weights) >= max_sum) {
    while (sum(weights) <= min_sum) {
      # i is a randomly selected index of weights vector
      tmpS <- S[(S >= cur_val) & (S <= max[i])]
      weights[i] <- tmpS[sample.int(1, length(tmpS))]
    }
    while (sum(weights) >= max_sum) {
      # i is a randomly selected index of weights vector
      tmpS <- S[(S >= cur_val) & (S <= max[i])]
      weights[i] <- tmpS[sample.int(1, length(tmpS))]
    }
  }
return(weights)
}
```

<!--
Mountain lake analogy

This is the most flexible method, but also the slowest, and can generate portfolios to satisfy sum of weights, box, group, position limit constraints.

it is often the case that the optimal portfolio is on the edge of the feasible space. this algorithm allows us to generate portfolios that evenly cover the interior and edges of feasible space.

* $S$ is the of feasible weights
* $weights$ is the vector of portfolio weights
* $min_sum$ is the lower bound on sum of weights
* $max_sum$ is the upper bound on sum of weights
* $min$ is the vector of lower bound box constraints
* $max$ is the vector of upper bound box constraints
randomly permute and increase a random portfolio element
randomly permute and decrease a random portfolio element
any sum of weights
box constraints

Other constraints?
* group
* number of assets
-->

---

## Adding Constraints
Think hard about the algorithm to support more constraint types by construction of the portfolio.
* sum of weights
* box
* group
* position limit (# of non-zero, # of long/short, etc.)
* leverage

<!--
My first attempt at v2 was to add conditions to the outer while loop and cross my fingers

after a lot of testing and frustration, I came to the algorithm that is currently implemented in PortfolioAnalytics
-->

---

## Adding Group Constraint
```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
rp <- function(x){
  while(violate_constraints(x)){
    x <- check_maxsum(x)
    x <- check_minsum(x)
    if(violate_group_constraints(x))
      x <- rp(x)
  }
  return(x)
}
```
* Note: code snippet is intentionally incomplete for the purpose of the slides

<!--
pseudo code to demonstrate modular approach of the algorithm and how we can look at the group constraint violation problem as the same problem as a portfolio that violates sum of weights. This results in a simple recursive call
while constraints violated

check for minimum sum of weights
randomly permute and increase a random portfolio element

check for maximum sum of weights
randomly permute and decrease a random portfolio element

check for group
group constraint violation is taking that subset of the portfolio and then you have the exact same problem as a portfolio that violates sum of weights constraint so we can just make a recursive call

## Optimization

### EDHEC Data Setup
Here we will look at portfolio optimization in the context of portfolio of hedge funds.

* EDHEC-Risk Alternative Indexes monthly returns from 1/31/1997 to 1/31/2014

Relative Value | Directional
-------------- | -----------
Convertible Arbitrage (CA) | CTA Global (CTAG)
Equity Market Neutral (EMN) | Emerging Markets (EM)
Fixed Income Arbitrage (FIA) | Global Macro (GM)

<!--
* Chosen to represent investing in hedge funds with different styles
* Not necessarily investable
* Style definitions

## Minimum Expected Shortfall
Consider an allocation to hedge funds using the EDHEC-Risk Alternative Index as a proxy.

* Minimize Modified Expected Shortfall
* Minimize Modified Expected Shortfall with Risk Budget Limit
* Minimize Modified Expected Shortfall with Equal Risk Contribution

<!--
Add risk budget objective to minimize concentration of percentage component contribution to risk. Concentration is defined as the Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI).

$$ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 $$

ES is coherent and is a convex function of the weights

We are actually using modified ES to take into account the higher moments because the return distribution displays skewness and kurtosis. Modified ES uses the Cornish-Fisher estimate of ES.

## Maximize CRRA
Consider an allocation to hedge funds using the EDHEC-Risk Alternative Index as a proxy. Our objective to maximize the fourth order expansion of the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) expected utility function as in the Boudt paper and Martellini paper. We use the same data as Example 3.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{w}{\text{maximize}}
& & EU(w) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\
& & & w_i \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
EU_{\lambda}(w) = - \frac{\lambda}{2} m_{(2)}(w) + 
\frac{\lambda (\lambda + 1)}{6} m_{(3)}(w) -
\frac{\lambda (\lambda + 1) (\lambda + 2)}{24} m_{(4)}(w)
$$

<!---
* This example will demonstrate a custom moment function and a custom objective function.
* This is an interesting objective function
* An increase in the 2nd and 4th moment will decrease the objective function
* An increase in the lambda value places a bigger penalty on the higher moments
-->

## Chart Results

![](figures/crra_RR_StdDev.png)

<!--
what results? what lambda?

It is very interesting to look at the feasible space in terms of different measures for risk. It appears that the optimal CRRA portfolio is close to the minimum StdDev portfolio, but nowhere near the minimum ES portfolio.

## DEoptim Extensions
* Mapping function in DEoptim
* ![](de.png)
* Seed population


<!--

random portfolio logic is used in a 

DEoptim only supports box constraints

an optional function that will be run after each population is created, but before the population is passed to the objective function. This allows the user to impose integer/cardinality constriants.
